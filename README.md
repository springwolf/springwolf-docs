## Updating the website & documentation

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The [docs](docs) folder contains all pages in Markdown format.

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
```
Make sure that you have installed all the dependencies in your local environment. You only need to run this command the first time
or after dependencies are updated.

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Language Style

The [vale](https://vale.sh) tool is used to verify the language style.
After installing, verify the documentation with
```bash
vale sync
vale docs/
```

Words not part of the dictionary yet are added in [accept.txt](.github/styles/config/vocabularies/Springwolf/accept.txt).
